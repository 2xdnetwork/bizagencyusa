              </div>
              <p class="font-weight-bold h5">Creating your online presence is the first step. Your website's online presence relies on a domain name and hosting service.</p>
              <p>Domains are the names of companies on the Internet. Our browser uses this address to access your website. Examples include usabizagency.com and google.com. Names are unique, so you might not be able to find the one you had in mind at the beginning.</p>
              <p>It can be difficult to choose the right domain name for your business. We can help you select the ideal name at usabizagency.com. In addition, you should ensure that it is not too long, easy to type, easy to remember, and that it does not contain the letter "Ã±", accents, hyphens, numbers or capital letters.</p>
              <p>Your website (or other content accessible via the web, such as email accounts, databases, etc.) is hosted on a server on the Internet. Hosting plays a crucial role in the speed with which the website loads, as well as the user experience. Users and profits can be lost if a server is interrupted.</p>
              <p>Choosing our Hosting means you get more than just a team of experts who manage your maintenance, support, and technical service. Your website will also be hosted on a stable, secure server with quick access.</p>

              <p class="font-weight-bold h5">Corporate mail is an indispensable part of every company's identity and communication tool.</p>
              <p>It also makes it easier for customers, suppliers, and the general public to distinguish your company from spam.</p>
              <p>Corporate emails also allow workers to separate their personal communications from their work communications. All work emails will be centralized in the company's hosting, safeguarding the written memory of labor communication exchange. Any query can be submitted at any time.</p>
              <p>By using free email services like Google, Yahoo, and others, you are showing your company that you take it seriously. Perhaps you think it's a business that just started and doesn't have much budget.</p>
              <p>With your own domain and hosting, your corporate emails will never end up in your customers' or suppliers' spam folders. You can also create emails for each work area to facilitate communication between customers and the public.</p>
              <p>In addition to helping to promote your brand or business, a professional corporate email is one of the most important reasons to have one. On many occasions, your brand will appear everywhere you go: when you deliver business cards, when you send emails, when you answer emails, etc.</p>
              <p>Feel free to contact us whenever you need help with web hosting or corporate email. We inform you and you make the decision.</p>
