                        <p>Confidential Information. For the purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means and includes the terms of this Agreement and any specifications, customer lists, subscriber lists, vendor, partner or agent lists, business plans, market launch schedules, drawings, sketches, models, samples, data, computer programs, proprietary data, intellectual property, know-how, proprietary systems or related documentation, or nonpublic technical, customer, financial or business information which is furnished or disclosed by either party (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other party (the “Receiving Party”) or to which the Receiving Party has access in the course of the conducting of the business and transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term Confidential Information shall not include information that (i) is publicly known at the time of its disclosure, (ii) is lawfully received by the Receiving Party from a third party not under an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party, (iii) is published or otherwise made known to the public or to a third party without imposing an obligation of confidentiality by the Disclosing Party, or (iv) was generated independently by the Receiving Party without use or reference to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.</p>

                        <p>Restrictions. The Receiving Party shall not disclose any of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to any person, or permit any person to use, examine or reproduce Confidential Information without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party unless disclosure is required by a valid subpoena, court order, government, judicial or regulatory authority or applicable law (in which case, the Receiving Party shall, to the extent legally permissible, notify the Disclosing Party of such request or requirement, reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing Party’s cost, to obtain the appropriate protective order or other remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and, in the event such protective order or remedy is not obtained or compliance with this Agreement is waived, disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed). The Receiving Party shall exercise at least the same degree of care to protect the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information which it exercises to protect the confidentiality of its own similar confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable care. Nothing herein can be construed to limit any greater or longer protections afforded to trade secrets under applicable law. Neither party shall disclose, publicize or advertise in any manner the specific terms of this Agreement, including pricing, without the prior written consent of the other party.</p>

                        <p>Limited Rights of Disclosure. Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, receiving party may, without the prior specific written authorization of the disclosing party, disclose and make available the disclosing party’s Confidential Information, on a confidential and restricted basis, to its employees, agents, independent contractors, and advisors who have a reasonable need-to-know or have access to such information and materials in connection with their obligations under this Agreement and the performance of the Services and who have been informed of and agreed to the confidentiality obligations under this Agreement.</p>

                        <p>Notice of Breach. The Receiving Party will promptly notify the Disclosing Party of any theft or unauthorized disclosure, reproduction or use of any Confidential Information, or any part of such information, of which the Receiving Party has knowledge.
                        Return of Information. Upon the request by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall, at its cost, return to the Disclosing Party or destroy all copies of documents, papers or other material which may contain or be derived from the Confidential Information, which are in its possession or control. The Receiving Party shall, upon request by the Disclosing Party, provide a certificate signed by the Receiving Party in form and substance satisfactory to both parties, stating that all the Confidential Information has been returned or destroyed in accordance with this Section 3.5. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, the Receiving Party may retain Confidential Information if such is legally required, but the confidentiality obligations above shall apply to any Confidential Information for as long as such is retained.</p>

                        <p>Injunctive Relief. The Receiving Party acknowledges that any violation of the provisions of this Section 3 may result in irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party, that the Disclosing Party may have no adequate remedy at law, and that the Disclosing Party shall have the right to seek equitable relief by the way of injunction to restrain such violation and to seek such further relief it may be entitled at law or in equity.
                        No Warranty. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTER RELATING TO THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
